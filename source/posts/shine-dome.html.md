I have a collection of vintage Canberra souvenirs including tablecloths, tea towels, spoons, scarves and postcards. The Australian Academy of Science was always featured on every one. It captures peopleâ€™s imagination because of the innovative and daring design by Roy Grounds completed in 1959.

My artwork reflects the familiarity Canberrans share with the Shine Dome and its resident wood ducks. Each element is hand painted in watercolour then scanned and digitally combined. Vintage Canberra travel posters often accentuated the feeling of spaciousness from an unusually high perspective. I used this structural form to pay homage to the magnificent Shine Dome, the Canberra landscape and its distant views.
