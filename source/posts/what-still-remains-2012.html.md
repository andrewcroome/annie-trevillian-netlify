**Annie Trevillian**, project artist, ACT Heritage Unit for What Still Remains: an ephemeral interpretation of the Valley Ruins as part of the 2012 Canberra and Region Heritage Festival 'Innovation' 14-29 April 2012.

**Site**: The Valley Ruins, Gungahlin Drive, beside Burgmann Anglican School.

Title: **Remnants**: the layering of time, memory and place in a landscape encompassing family and community.

Annie designed motifs inspired by research into The Valley Ruins heritage site. This  included imagery derived from actual artefacts from the site, buildings and structures, orchard and plantings, food, animals, machinery and objects to illustrate the everyday existence of the men, women and children who lived there including Indigenous and European settlers. Annie used these motifs to produce a place-specific ephemeral artwork.

An important part of the project was public engagement and community participation. Annie has a long history of facilitating community arts projects as well as teaching and running workshops. She worked with students of Dickson College and Burgmann Anglican School. She  facilitated a daylong print workshop at Megalo Print Studio and Gallery for the general public during Heritage Week.
