**Annie Trevillian**, project artist, ACT Heritage Unit for What Still Remains: an ephemeral interpretation of the Valley Ruins as part of the 2012 Canberra and Region Heritage Festival 'Innovation' 14-29 April 2012.

**Site**: The Valley Ruins, Gungahlin Drive, beside Burgmann Anglican School.

Title: **Remnants**: the layering of time, memory and place in a landscape encompassing family and community.

Annie designed motifs inspired by research into The Valley Ruins heritage site. This  included imagery derived from actual artefacts from the site, buildings and structures, orchard and plantings, food, animals, machinery and objects to illustrate the everyday existence of the men, women and children who lived there including Indigenous and European settlers. Annie used these motifs to produce a place-specific ephemeral artwork.
