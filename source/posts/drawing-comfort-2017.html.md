**Annie Trevillian**

My studio is the ultimate place of drawing comfort/comfort drawing. Drawing and painting flowers, trees and more recently birds, in watercolour and gouache, is my interpretation of the Canberra landscape I have grown up with. The process of layering and repetition of detail and colour is informed by both my background in textile design and my love of the screenprinting process. I use this knowledge when I scan and digitally combine the elements to create new images.Photoshop and digital printing are a natural progression of my painting and printing skills and allows me to draw comfort from my familiar Canberra motifs.
