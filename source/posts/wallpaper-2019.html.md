Annie Trevillian Wallpaper  and Textile design

Just as screenprinting and digital printing plays around with the notion of layering so does the act of drawing, painting and collage. In all of Annie’s practice the strong foundation of the drawn or painted image is the start of a design journey. Watercolour, gouache, acrylic, coloured pencil, graphite and crayons have been used to create the images. The images are then scanned and cleaned up in Photoshop. The imagery is manipulated layer by layer. Annie’s long-standing experience as a textile designer informs her approach to pattern making, using repetition and colour as a way of achieving design symmetry. The output can be varied and limitless: digital print on a variety of textiles, metal, wallpaper or glass to name a few.
