Backyard Toile â€“ a storied cloth

In Photoshop I gardened. I planted my newly painted images. I cleaned them, I coaxed them into healthy looking motifs, I moved them around and gave them more light and breathing space. I bunched them together or weeded them out. I pruned and propagated. I enjoyed their uniqueness. I adored their overall beauty and ability to create pleasure. I cajoled them into a landscape based on my own observations from my studio window. I patterned my backyard and it told a story of my time during lockdown. It is a movable, changing, surprising and so, so deeply satisfying story.
